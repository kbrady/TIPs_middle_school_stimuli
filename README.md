# Web Stimuli for TIPs ebook tests in middle schools

## Services we may want to use:
#### Tracking:
* Clicky: Tracks users. I think this is more than we need

#### Note Taking:
* (Marker.to)[marker.to]: A web browser extension that lets you highlight and share text.
* Diigo: Tool bar for Internet Explorer or Firefox which lets you take notes and highlight
* Scrible: Note taking extension for Firefox and Chrome

#### Text-to-Speech:
A lot of text-to-speech engines are made for Webkit and thus won't work in Chrome.
Viable options include:
* meSpeak.js
* Google's text-to-speech
